Add custom fields to your post types

== Description ==

Custom Field Suite (CFS) lets you add custom fields to your posts. It's lightweight and battle-tested (there's not much to break).

= Things to know =
* We do not provide support.
* This is a free plugin. We're not selling anything.
* The upstream CFS 2.6.7 release includes 14 field types. This maintenance build adds Checkbox and Radio Button fields to help migration from existing CFS sites.
* If you want all the bells-and-whistles, use ACF.

= Field types =
* Text
* Textarea
* WYSIWYG
* Date
* Color
* True / False
* Select
* Checkbox
* Radio Button
* File Upload
* Relationship
* Term
* User
* Loop (repeatable fields)
* Hyperlink
* Tab (group fields)

= Usage =
* Browse to the "Field Groups" admin menu
* Create a Field Group containing one or more custom fields
* Choose where the Field Group should appear, using the Placement Rules box
* Use the [get](https://mgibbs189.github.io/custom-field-suite/api/get.html) method in your template files to display custom fields

= Security maintenance notes =
This package includes local security and compatibility hardening on top of the upstream 2.6.7 codebase.

This maintenance build is inherited and maintained by @shift Yoshiya Tsuchisaka. The original Custom Field Suite copyright, authorship, and GPLv2 license notices are preserved.

This maintenance build addresses the known 2024 CFS vulnerability classes around Loop field code execution, Term field SQL injection, and CFS form title/content stored XSS. It also keeps the existing public-form behavior where new posts may be created, while requiring normal WordPress edit capabilities before an existing post can be updated.

The changes were verified against the built-in CFS field types, the added Checkbox and Radio Button fields, and an upgrade path from the original 2.6.7 codebase. These checks are local verification only and are not a third-party security audit.

= Redistribution and license =
This maintenance build is distributed under the GNU General Public License version 2 (GPLv2), the same license as the upstream plugin. You may use, copy, modify, and redistribute this package, including modified versions, under GPLv2.

When redistributing this package, keep the GPLv2 license notice, preserve the original author attribution, include the source code, and make clear that this is a maintenance build inherited by @shift Yoshiya Tsuchisaka. This software is provided without warranty, to the extent permitted by law.
