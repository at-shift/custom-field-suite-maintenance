# Custom Field Suite Maintenance Build

This repository contains a security and compatibility maintenance build of
Custom Field Suite, based on the upstream Custom Field Suite 2.6.7 codebase.

Custom Field Suite is a WordPress plugin for adding custom fields to posts,
pages, and custom post types.

## Maintenance Version

Current maintenance version: 2.6.7.11

Plugin download:
https://github.com/at-shift/custom-field-suite-maintenance/archive/refs/heads/main.zip

GitHub ZIP downloads are extracted as `custom-field-suite-maintenance-main`.
Before installing or replacing an existing WordPress plugin, rename the extracted
folder to `custom-field-suite` and place it at:

```text
wp-content/plugins/custom-field-suite
```

Versioning follows the upstream 2.6.7 base version with an additional maintenance
suffix. Future stabilization updates should increment the final number, for
example 2.6.7.12, 2.6.7.13, and so on.

## Security and Compatibility Changes

This build includes security and compatibility hardening on top of upstream
2.6.7.

Main changes:

- Removed Loop field `eval()` rendering and replaced it with structured lookup
  logic.
- Normalized Relationship, Term, and User field IDs before saving and querying.
- Sanitized CFS form `post_title` and `post_content` submissions to reduce
  stored XSS risk.
- Added capability checks before CFS form submissions update existing posts.
- Hardened session queries, import/export handling, reverse-relationship
  filtering, and serialized field data loading.
- Escaped admin field output across field settings, tabs, file links, selected
  Relationship / Term / User labels, and generated JSON.
- Stabilized PHP 8.2+ admin edit screen compatibility.
- Fixed TinyMCE code plugin loading for CFS WYSIWYG fields.

## Verification

The maintenance build was locally verified against:

- PHP syntax checks across the plugin.
- Standard CFS save/read behavior.
- All built-in CFS field types:
  Text, Textarea, WYSIWYG, Hyperlink, Date, Color, True / False, Select,
  Relationship, Term, User, File, Loop, and Tab.
- XSS and SQL hardening checks for the modified areas.
- Replacement from the original upstream 2.6.7 plugin to this maintenance build.
- WordPress admin post edit screen compatibility on PHP 8.3.

These checks are local verification only and are not a third-party security
audit.

## Installation

Copy the renamed `custom-field-suite` directory to:

```text
wp-content/plugins/custom-field-suite
```

Then activate Custom Field Suite from the WordPress admin Plugins screen.

When replacing an existing Custom Field Suite 2.6.7 installation, back up the
site files and database first.
